 * Modded by Boolbada of OP mod, from Engineer repair enter activity.
 * Note: You can still use this without modifying the OpenRA engine itself by deleting
 * FindAndTransitionToNextState. I just deleted a few lines of "movement" recovery code so that
 * interceptors can enter moving carrier.
 * However, for better results, consider modding the engine, as in the following commit:
 * https://github.com/forcecore/OpenRA/commit/fd36f63e508b7ad28e7d320355b7d257654b33ee
 * Also, interceptors sometimes try to land on ground level.
 * To mitigate that, I added LnadingDistance in Spawned trait.
 * However, that isn't perfect. For perfect results, Land.cs of the engine must be modified:
 * https://github.com/forcecore/OpenRA/commit/45970f57283150bc57ce86b8ce8a555018c6ca14
 * I couldn't make it independent as it relies on other stuff in Enter.cs too much.
